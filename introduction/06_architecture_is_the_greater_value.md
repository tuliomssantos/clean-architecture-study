#   Architecture Is The Greter Value

Is it more important that the software has the functions working, or is it more important that the software is easy to change?

*   Business managers will say: working is better
*   Developers will follow them


**That is the wrong attitude.**

##  Evidence of the claim:

*   If a software works perfectly but it is impossible to modify. So it will not work if the requirements change and it will become useless.

*   If a software doesn't work, but it is easy to change, then we can modify it to meet the new requirements and continue to do so whenever the requirements change.

*   Beahavior - Urgent but not always important.
*   Architecture - Important but never particularly urgent.
