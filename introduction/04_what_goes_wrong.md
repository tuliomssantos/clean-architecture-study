#  What goes wrong

*   Overconfidence
*   *"We have to get to market first"*
*   *"We can clean it up later"*

When this software starts to be used, and more functionalities should be appended into it, and changes should be done in it, the mess starts to decrease productivity.

It's a mistake believe that delivering messy code, and bad structured software, will provide fast in short term and only will slows in the long term.

In software development ***The only way to go fast, is to go well***.

If your system and your team are already in this mess, just starting development again will end up leading to the same problem.
