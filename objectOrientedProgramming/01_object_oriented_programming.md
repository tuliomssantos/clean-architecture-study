#   Object-Oriented Programming

The basis of a good architecture is the understanding and application of the principles of objected-oriented desing.

##  What is Objeted-Oriented ?

*   “The combination of data and function."
*   “A way to model the real world.”
*   "Objeted-Oriented makes software easier to understand because it has a closer relationship to the real world"
*   (Abstração), Encapsulamento, Herança e Polimorfismo.

**To the software architect, however, the answer is clear: OO is the ability, through the use of polymorphism, to gain absolute control over every source code dependency in the system. It allows the architect to create a plugin architecture, in which modules that contain high-level policies are independent of modules that contain low-level details. The low-level details are relegated to plugin modules that can be deployed and developed independently from the modules that contain high-level policies.**
