#  Two values: Behavior and Architecture

A Software provides two values: Behavior and Architecture.

## Behavior

Programmers are usually hired to solve problems so that the machines make or save some stakeholder money.

We usually do this as follows:
*   Producing together with the stakeholders a document of functional requirements and specifications.
*   Producing a code that makes the machines execute the specifications and functionalities.
*   When machines do something unexpected, programmers try to remove the bug and restore the desired behavior.

Many programmers believe that is the entirety of their job.

## Architecture

For software to be really soft, it must be easily modified. This is not usually the case. This is the problem with bad architecture.

In poorly designed software each new requirement, each modification, seems that the parts have more difficulty connecting and the changes become more difficult to do.

When the software has this problem, each new feature seems to ask for something like fitting a square pin into a round entry.
