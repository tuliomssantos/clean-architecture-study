We usually see the word architecture to define the high level of planning, and design to describe the lower level details.

The author gives us an example of the architecture of a house.
The architecture is:
*   The shape of the home
*   The outward appearance
*   The elevations
*   The layout of the spaces and rooms

In the diagrams of the architect there is immense number of low-level details and how things should be constructed. 

There are represented how the little details support all the high-level decisions.

The same idea could be applied to software architecture.
