# Clean Architecture

> **We should organize our codebase around the business rules and not around the frameworks we use to achieve business rules.**

> _Careless teams and individuals can get in a dangerous situation by structuring their systems around the tools they use. Business rules get mixed up with implementation details. This can result in a brittle system, hard to extend and maintain._
