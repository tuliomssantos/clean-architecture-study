#  The goal of good software design?

Then, the author provides the goals. And this phrases were very impactful to me:

>   **The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.**

>   **The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer.**

>   **If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good.**

>   **If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad. Itâ€™s as simple as that.**

If you have ever participated in the development and maintenance of software, or if you are already a stakeholder, you probably will se the truth of this words.

But how achieve this? How can we produce and maintain quality software with few resources?

Well that is the good question and our goal.
